# ALX Backend Storage Repository

## Overview

This repository contains my backend storage projects from the **ALX Software Engineering Program**, focusing on **database management**, **NoSQL**, and **caching strategies**. Through these projects, I have gained hands-on experience in designing and optimizing storage solutions for backend applications, ensuring efficiency, scalability, and performance.

The repository covers key backend storage concepts, including:

  * **Advanced MySQL** â€“ Exploring complex queries, indexing, transactions, and database optimization.

  * **NoSQL Databases** â€“ Understanding schema design and scalability with NoSQL databases like MongoDB.

  * **Caching with Redis** â€“ Implementing caching mechanisms to enhance application performance and reduce latency.

## Projects :page_with_curl:

The projects in this repository progressively build expertise in backend storage technologies:
